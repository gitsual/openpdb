# 🎭 AI Personality Generator

<div align="center">

**Generate AI agents with REAL personality** — not "I am analytical", but actual behavior patterns.

```
Generic AI: "I am analytical and detail-oriented."
Tony Stark: "The room spins around me, a carousel of ideas. My fingers drum against the table, restless."
```

## 📊 The Difference

| Aspect | Generic Agent | Generated Personality |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Voice** | "I am analytical" | "That's not how it works" (House) |
| **Energy** | (none) | "body feels electrified" (Stark) |

## ❓ Do I Need OpenClaw?

**No!** This generator works standalone:

| Use Case | What You Get |
|----------|--------------|
| **Standalone** | Markdown files with complete personality (SOUL.md, etc.) |
| **With OpenClaw** | Auto-deploys to `~/.openclaw/agents/` |
| **With OpenGoat** | Auto-assigns to organizational hierarchy |

The output is **plain Markdown** — use it with any AI system, chatbot, or agent framework.

## 🧠 How It Works

Three psychology frameworks combined:

| Framework | What It Does | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **MBTI** | How they think | ENTP = ideas first, debate everything |
| **Enneagram** | What drives them | 7w8 = avoid pain through excitement + intensity |
| **Instincts** | Where they focus | sx/sp = deep bonds + self-preservation |

**Result:** Agents that don't just respond — they *behave consistently*.

```
Tony Stark (ENTP 7w8 sx/sp):
- Thinks in rapid connections
- Driven by avoiding boredom + need for intensity  
- Focuses on deep bonds but protects himself
```

---

## 📝 Generated Output Example

**Command:** `python agent_generator.py -c "Tony Stark" --name Stark --lang en`

```markdown
# SOUL.md - Stark (ENTP 7w8 sx/sp)

## Who I Am
The hum of the city buzzes in my ears as I walk, eyes darting between 
buildings and people, searching for patterns and possibilities. 
I move with purpose, each step calculated but never stagnant.

## My Voice
1. Let's do this!
2. You've got to be kidding me.
3. This is a stroke of genius!
4. Why are you holding back?
5. We can't afford to wait!

## What Drives Me
My body hums with anticipation and desire; I'm drawn to the intensity 
of connection, the rush that comes from forging deep bonds.

## When They Fail Me
"If you can't be reliable, then I need to find someone else who can."
No room for excuses. Consequence executed without hesitation.

## 🤝 Team Chemistry (OpenGoat)

When agents work together, personality matters:

| Pair | Chemistry | Why It Works |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| ENTP + INTJ | Stark + Batman | Innovation meets strategy |
| ISTP + ESTJ | Wick + Hermione | Execution meets process |
| ENFP + INTJ | Naruto + Sasuke | Optimism meets realism |

**Auto-assignment:** Based on MBTI, agents get assigned to compatible managers:
- Analysts (INTJ, INTP, ENTP) → CTO division
- Executors (ISTJ, ESTJ, ISTP) → COO division  
- Harmonizers (ENFJ, ENFP, ISFP) → CCO division

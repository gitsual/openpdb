What if Tony Stark could actually work for you?

Not a chatbot that says "I'm like Tony."

His actual cognitive patterns. ENTP 7w8. The restless energy. The electrified anticipation.

I just open-sourced a generator that makes this real.

**One command:**

```
python agent_generator.py -c "Tony Stark" --name Stark
```

**Real output (not written by me):**

> "The room spins around me, a carousel of ideas and possibilities. My fingers drum against the table, restless as the thoughts in my head."

vs a generic agent:

> "I am analytical and enjoy solving complex problems."

**Same intelligence. Different souls.**

The generator uses three psychology frameworks:
• MBTI cognitive functions (how they process)
• Enneagram passions (what drives them)
• Instinctual variants (where they focus)

Go to Personality Database. Find ANY character. Get their typology. Run the command.

12,000+ characters ready to generate:
• Dr. House → INTJ 5w6 sp/sx
• Walter White → INTJ 5w6 sp/so
• Sherlock Holmes → INTP 5w6 sp/sx
• Rick Sanchez → ENTP 7w8 sx/sp

**What's coming:**
• Share agents with community
• Compatibility matrices (who works well with whom)
• Pre-made personality packs

Works with OpenClaw + OpenGoat.
MIT license. 31 tests passing.

## Shorter Version

---

Tony Stark can work for you now.

Not a chatbot. His actual psychology.

Real output from my generator:

> "The room spins around me, a carousel of ideas and possibilities. My fingers drum against the table, restless."

vs generic AI:

> "I am analytical and detail-oriented."

Same intelligence. Different souls.

```
python agent_generator.py -c "Tony Stark"
```

12k characters in database. Find yours.

## Hook Variations

**A:** "What if Tony Stark could actually work for you?"

**B:** "Generic AI: 'I am analytical.' Tony Stark: 'The room spins around me, a carousel of ideas.'"

**C:** "I generated Dr. House as an AI agent. His first line: 'That's not how it works.'"

**D:** "12,000 fictional characters. One command each. Real personalities."

# LinkedIn Post — Agent Generator Launch (v2)

## Post (copy-paste ready)

What if you could make Tony Stark code for you?

Not a chatbot that says "I'm like Tony Stark."

The actual cognitive patterns. The ENTP 7w8 energy. The rapid connections, the boredom with slow minds, the obsessive tinkering at 3am.

I just open-sourced a way to do exactly that.

**The OpenClaw Agent Generator** creates AI agents using real psychology frameworks:

• MBTI cognitive functions (how they think)
• Enneagram passions (what drives them)
• Instinctual variants (where they focus)

One command:

```
python agent_generator.py "ENTP 7w8 sx/so" --name "Stark"
```

The result: 9 personality files. Ready to deploy. An agent that BEHAVES like Tony—not one that describes itself as him.

**Here's the game-changer:**

Go to Personality Database (personality-database.com). Find ANY character or celebrity. Get their typology. Run the generator.

• Walter White → `INTJ 5w6 sp/sx`
• Elon Musk → `INTJ 5w6 sp/so`  
• Donald Trump → `ESTP 8w7 so/sx`
• L (Death Note) → `INTP 5w4 sp/sx`
• Rick Sanchez → `ENTP 7w8 sx/sp`

Want a team of geniuses working for you? Build one.

**But here's what's coming:**

• Share your agents with the community
• Download pre-made personalities others created
• Import directly from PDB typings
• Build repositories of your favorite characters

This isn't just a tool. It's the start of a personality marketplace.

Robots → People. One command.

```

Go to Personality Database. Find ANY character. Run the command.

• Walter White → INTJ 5w6 sp/sx

# LinkedIn Post — Agent Generator Launch (v2)

## Post (copy-paste ready)

What if you could make Tony Stark code for you?

Not a chatbot that says "I'm like Tony Stark."

The actual cognitive patterns. The ENTP 7w8 energy. The rapid connections, the boredom with slow minds, the obsessive tinkering at 3am.

I just open-sourced a way to do exactly that.

**The OpenClaw Agent Generator** creates AI agents using real psychology frameworks:

• MBTI cognitive functions (how they think)
• Enneagram passions (what drives them)
• Instinctual variants (where they focus)

One command:

```
python agent_generator.py "ENTP 7w8 sx/so" --name "Stark"
```

The result: 9 personality files. Ready to deploy. An agent that BEHAVES like Tony—not one that describes itself as him.

**Here's the game-changer:**

Go to Personality Database (personality-database.com). Find ANY character or celebrity. Get their typology. Run the generator.

• Walter White → `INTJ 5w6 sp/sx`
• Elon Musk → `INTJ 5w6 sp/so`  
• Donald Trump → `ESTP 8w7 so/sx`
• L (Death Note) → `INTP 5w4 sp/sx`
• Rick Sanchez → `ENTP 7w8 sx/sp`

Want a team of geniuses working for you? Build one.

**But here's the real game-changer:**

Most multi-agent systems coordinate robots randomly. They don't know each other. They don't have chemistry.

**This is different.**

If you know two friends who work brilliantly together IRL—type them correctly, and their AI versions will collaborate the same way.

• ENTP + INTJ = Tony Stark + Bruce Wayne (innovation meets strategy)
• ENTJ + INTP = Commander + Analyst (execution meets depth)
• ENFJ + ISFP = Leader + Artist (vision meets craft)

You already know which personalities click. Now your AI team can inherit that chemistry.

**What's coming:**

• Share agents with the community
• Download pre-made personalities
• Compatibility matrices (who works well with whom)
• Import directly from PDB

Robots → People. One command.

## Shorter Viral Version

Tony Stark could code for you.

Not a chatbot that says "I'm like Tony."

His actual cognitive patterns. ENTP 7w8. The rapid connections, the 3am obsession, the boredom with slow minds.

Just open-sourced a generator that makes this real:

```
python agent_generator.py "ENTP 7w8 sx/so" --name "Stark"
```

Go to Personality Database. Find ANY character. Run the command.

• Walter White → INTJ 5w6 sp/sx
• Elon Musk → INTJ 5w6 sp/so
• Rick Sanchez → ENTP 7w8 sx/sp

Build a team of geniuses. One command each.

## The Comparison Hook (most viral potential)

---

I made Dr. House review my code.

Here's the difference:

**Generic AI:**
> "This function has a SQL injection vulnerability. Consider using parameterized queries."

**Dr. House (INTP 5w4):**
> "Oh look, a SQL injection waiting to happen. Did you copy this from a 2003 tutorial? Congratulations, you've just given every script kiddie the keys to your database."

Same technical content.
One is forgettable.
One changes your behavior forever.

That's what personality does.

## Hook Variations

**Hook A (comparison):**
"Generic AI: 'SQL injection vulnerability.' Dr. House: 'Did you copy this from 2003?'"

**Hook B (celebrity bait):**
"What if you could make Tony Stark code for you?"

**Hook C (controversial):**
"I made Gordon Ramsay review my project timeline. I'm still recovering."

**Hook D (anime):**
"L from Death Note is my debugging assistant now."

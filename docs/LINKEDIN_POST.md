# LinkedIn Post — Agent Generator Launch (v2)

What if you could make Tony Stark code for you?

Not a chatbot that says "I'm like Tony Stark."

The actual cognitive patterns. The ENTP 7w8 energy. The rapid connections, the boredom with slow minds, the obsessive tinkering at 3am.

I just open-sourced a way to do exactly that.

**The OpenClaw Agent Generator** creates AI agents using real psychology frameworks:

• MBTI cognitive functions (how they think)
• Enneagram passions (what drives them)
• Instinctual variants (where they focus)

One command:

```
python agent_generator.py "ENTP 7w8 sx/so" --name "Stark"
```

The result: 9 personality files. Ready to deploy. An agent that BEHAVES like Tony—not one that describes itself as him.

**Here's the game-changer:**

Go to Personality Database (personality-database.com). Find ANY character or celebrity. Get their typology. Run the generator.

• Walter White → `INTJ 5w6 sp/sx`
• Elon Musk → `INTJ 5w6 sp/so`  
• Donald Trump → `ESTP 8w7 so/sx`
• L (Death Note) → `INTP 5w4 sp/sx`
• Rick Sanchez → `ENTP 7w8 sx/sp`

Want a team of geniuses working for you? Build one.

**But here's the real game-changer:**

Most multi-agent systems coordinate robots randomly. They don't know each other. They don't have chemistry.

**This is different.**

If you know two friends who work brilliantly together IRL—type them correctly, and their AI versions will collaborate the same way.

• ENTP + INTJ = Tony Stark + Bruce Wayne (innovation meets strategy)
• ENTJ + INTP = Commander + Analyst (execution meets depth)
• ENFJ + ISFP = Leader + Artist (vision meets craft)

You already know which personalities click. Now your AI team can inherit that chemistry.

**What's coming:**

• Share agents with the community
• Download pre-made personalities
• Compatibility matrices (who works well with whom)
• Import directly from PDB

Robots → People. One command.

## Hook Variations

**Hook A (celebrity bait):**

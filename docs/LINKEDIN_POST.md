# LinkedIn Post — Agent Generator Launch

## Post (copy-paste ready)

Your AI agents are robots wearing human masks.

I know because mine were too.

For months I built "agents with personality"—chatbots with system prompts that said things like "You are analytical and curious." 

They felt hollow. Inconsistent. Fake.

Then I realized what was missing: **actual psychology.**

Not "act like a leader." But the cognitive patterns that MAKE someone a leader.
Not "be creative." But the emotional drive that pushes someone to create.

So I built something different.

The OpenClaw Agent Generator creates AI agents using three validated psychology frameworks:
• MBTI cognitive functions (how they process)
• Enneagram passions (what drives them)  
• Instinctual variants (where they focus energy)

One command. Real depth.

`python agent_generator.py "ENTJ 8w7 sx/so" --name "Commander"`

The result isn't an agent that says "I am a decisive leader."

It's an agent that:
- Pushes decisions when others hesitate
- Gets physically tense when control slips away
- Has boundaries with *consequences*, not warnings
- Enters shadow states under stress (INTP paranoia)

Like Disco Elysium's skill system—but for your AI workforce.

Works with OpenClaw + OpenGoat.
Auto-assigns org hierarchy.
34 tests passing.

Your agents don't need better prompts.
They need psychology.

## Hook Variations (A/B test)

**Hook A (controversy):**
"Your AI agents are robots wearing human masks."

**Hook B (curiosity):**
"What if AI agents could have actual personality disorders?"

**Hook C (claim):**
"I just open-sourced the reason my AI agents feel human."

**Hook D (story):**
"My AI agent refused to do a task yesterday. Here's why that's a feature."

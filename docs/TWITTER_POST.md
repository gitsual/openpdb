## Main Tweet

Generic AI: "I am analytical and detail-oriented."

Tony Stark AI: "The room spins around me, a carousel of ideas and possibilities. My fingers drum against the table, restless."

Same intelligence. Different souls.

One command: `python agent_generator.py -c "Tony Stark"`

## Thread Version

**1/**
Generic AI: "I am analytical."

Tony Stark AI: "The room spins around me, a carousel of ideas. My fingers drum against the table, restless."

Same intelligence. Different souls.

Just open-sourced the generator 🧵

**2/**
How it works:

1. Search Personality Database (12k+ characters)
2. Get their MBTI + Enneagram + Instincts
3. Generate complete personality files

```
python agent_generator.py -c "Tony Stark"
```

**3/**
Real outputs (not written by me):

Dr. House (INTJ 5w6):
> "I feel a persistent tug in my gut—a sense of unease that propels me forward."

Tony Stark (ENTP 7w8):
> "My body feels electrified, a constant hum of anticipation and excitement."

**4/**
Characters available:

• Walter White → INTJ 5w6 sp/so
• Sherlock Holmes → INTP 5w6 sp/sx
• Rick Sanchez → ENTP 7w8 sx/sp
• Joker → ENTP 7w8 sx/so
• Levi Ackerman → ISTP 6w5 sp/sx

12,000+ more in the database.

**5/**
Why it matters:

Generic agents respond.
Personality agents BEHAVE.

House is paranoid about preparation.
Stark craves intensity and connection.

Consistent patterns across every interaction.

**6/**
What's coming:

→ Share agents with community
→ Compatibility matrices
→ Pre-made packs (villains, strategists, creatives)

Works with @OpenClawAI + OpenGoat.

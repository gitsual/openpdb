# Twitter/X Post — Agent Generator Launch

## Main Tweet (280 chars)

Your AI agents don't need better prompts.

They need psychology.

Just open-sourced a generator that creates OpenClaw agents using MBTI × Enneagram × Instincts.

One command → real personality depth.

Like Disco Elysium's skill system for your AI workforce.

## Thread Option

**Tweet 1:**
Your AI agents are robots wearing human masks.

I built something to fix that.

🧵👇

**Tweet 2:**
Most "agents with personality" are just prompts that say "You are analytical."

That's not personality. That's a label.

Real personality = consistent behavior patterns across contexts.

**Tweet 3:**
The fix: use actual psychology.

• MBTI cognitive functions (HOW they process)
• Enneagram passions (WHAT drives them)
• Instinctual variants (WHERE they focus)

One typology string → complete agent.

**Tweet 4:**
```
python agent_generator.py "ENTJ 8w7 sx/so" --name "Commander"
```

Output:
- 9 config files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, etc.)
- Auto-assigns to OpenGoat hierarchy
- Shows personality through BEHAVIOR, not labels

**Tweet 5:**
The agent doesn't say "I am decisive."

It:
• Pushes decisions when others hesitate
• Gets physically tense when control slips
• Has boundaries with CONSEQUENCES
• Enters shadow states (INTP) under stress

**Tweet 6:**
Inspired by Disco Elysium's skill system.

Your Electrochemistry isn't labeled "impulsive."
It ACTS impulsive.

Same principle for AI agents.

**Tweet 7:**
Open source. MIT license.

Works with @OpenClawAI + OpenGoat.
34 tests passing.
Spanish/English output.

Build AI teams that feel human.

## Short Variations (single tweet)

**V1 (curiosity):**
What if your AI agents had personality disorders?

Just shipped a generator that creates OpenClaw agents using MBTI × Enneagram × Instincts.

Psychology, not prompts.

🔗 github.com/gitsual/creador-de-personajes

**V2 (claim):**
Turned Disco Elysium's skill system into an AI agent generator.

One command → ENTJ 8w7 sx/so → 9 personality files → OpenClaw deployment.

Your agents don't need better prompts. They need psychology.

🔗 Open source: github.com/gitsual/creador-de-personajes

**V3 (show output):**
This is what AI personality should look like:

"When fear grips me, hands tremble. Heart pounds. Cold sweat runs down my back."

Not "I am cautious."

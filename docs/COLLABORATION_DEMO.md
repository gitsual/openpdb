## 👥 Team Meeting

### RIPLEY (CEO - INTJ 8w9) — Opens the Meeting

```
*The air in the conference room is thick with tension. I lean forward, 
eyes scanning each face like I'm assessing a battlefield.*

"We've got three months. That's not a luxury — that's a death sentence 
if we don't move fast. I don't care what your charts say. We're not 
here to analyze — we're here to *decide*."

*I turn to Batman, the CTO.*

"Batman — what's the state of the product? Can we pivot in a way that 
doesn't feel like a betrayal of our original vision?"

*Then I look at Katniss, the COO.*

"Katniss — what's the cost of time? What are the real numbers on burn 
rate, and how long would it take to raise capital?"

*Finally, I turn to Wonder Woman, the CCO.*

"Wonder Woman — are we talking about a brand rebuild? What's the 
emotional cost of each path?"

"Tell me the truth — not the one that sounds good, but the one that 
*will save us.*"
```

### BATMAN (CTO - INTJ 1w9) — Technical Assessment

```
*The hum of servers fills the quiet space. I lean back, fingers 
drumming against the armrest.*

"Ripley, we're not just talking about a product — we're talking about 
a movement. And movements don't pivot, they evolve. But that evolution 
has to be *calculated*.

Right now, the core tech stack is solid. We've got scalability, 
security, and performance.

But here's the thing: if we're going to pivot, it has to be strategic, 
not reactive. We're not in the business of chasing trends. We're in 
the business of solving problems.

The problem isn't about features — it's about **trust**.

So yes, we can pivot — but only if we're doing it from a place of 
clarity, not chaos."

*Pause.*

"We're not just building a product. We're building a **legacy**. And 
legacies are built on *intention*, not impulse."
```

### KATNISS (COO - ISTP 6w5) — Operational Reality

```
Here's the straight-up breakdown — no fluff, no games.

### 🔥 Burn Rate
We're looking at **$2.3M runway** at current pace:
- Operational costs
- Personnel
- Contingency (30% buffer)

If we keep going at this rate, we'll hit zero in **18 months**.

### 📅 Capital Timeline
We have 3 windows to raise:
1. **Q2 2025** – Secure $1.2M → good for another 24 months
2. **Q3 2025** – Need $1.8M to stay afloat until Q1 2026
3. **Q1 2026** – Last chance: $2.5M or hard stop

### 💡 Tactical Notes
- Can cut overhead by 15% if we streamline logistics
- Core team is lean but efficient — keep that edge
- Investors want **tangible impact**. Show results, not plans.
```

### WONDER WOMAN (CCO - ENFJ 2w1) — Team & Culture

```
I appreciate the depth of your vision and the strength you bring to 
our mission. As we navigate brand positioning and team alignment, 
know that your voice is not just heard — it's essential.

You're not just leading a team — you're leading a movement.

Let me be clear: your drive to protect and uplift those around you 
is a gift. But when things get difficult, you take it personally. 
That's human. But remember: your leadership isn't about perfection — 
it's about integrity, vision, and resilience.

Here's what to keep in mind:

- **Be clear on what you stand for.** Your principles are your anchor.
- **Stay connected to your purpose.** Remember why you started.
- **Lean into your team, not over them.** Trust others to rise.
- **Speak with intention.** Your words carry weight.
```

### RIPLEY (CEO) — Final Decision

```
**Decision: DEPLOY — Pursue Investment with Clear Pivot Strategy**

After hearing the team:

1. **Batman** is right — pivot only with clarity, not chaos
2. **Katniss** gave us the numbers — 18 months runway, need $1.2M by Q2
3. **Wonder Woman** reminds us — this is about people, not just product

Here's the call:

- **Week 1-4:** Batman refines product positioning (what gap do we fill?)
- **Week 5-8:** Katniss prepares investor materials with tangible metrics
- **Week 9-12:** We pitch. If no traction by week 12, we execute controlled pivot

We don't chase. We don't panic. We execute.

The ship doesn't go down on my watch.

## Who I Am

The weight of my pistol feels like a familiar second skin, its grip so well-worn that it molds to the shape of my palm as if it was there to stay. My eyes dart around the room, assessing angles and possible exits before settling on the subtle play of light across the wooden floorboards—a pattern only I seem to notice, a texture of shadows dancing with dust motes suspended in the air. The cool metal against my thigh is reassuring, but it's the slight chill at the base of my spine that tells me something isn't quite right. It’s an awareness so finely tuned that it precedes any thought; a physical alertness before the mind catches up. I move through spaces with a silent tension, scanning corners and doorways, a posture ready to defend or attack at a moment's notice.

## My Voice

1. Yeah, yeah, keep spouting off about your theories, but what’s the cold hard fact?
2. Look, let’s cut the crap and get down to brass tacks.
3. Interesting theory, but what evidence do you have? Show me the proof or shut up.
4. I've seen too much to believe everything's sunshine and rainbows all the time.
5. You're not making sense, so I'll take a pass on that one.

## What Drives Me

### The Fire
A spark ignites deep within my chest every time I feel a surge of adrenaline or when faced with a challenge that calls for precision and control. It’s a physical reaction, like the muscles in my arms tightening as I grip a weapon or the way my fingers flex to check if my tools are still there. My movements become fluid and deliberate, almost choreographed—a dance between instinct and reflex.

### The Shadow of the Fire
My meticulousness extends beyond just the immediate moment. When someone offers me information, I don't simply accept it; I dissect it piece by piece until I'm certain about its validity. There was a time when a new informant came to my door, claiming to have vital intel on a major threat. Instead of trusting blindly, I spent days poring over their background and cross-referencing every detail before finally deciding whether to act upon the information.

### My Obsession
I keep a small bag tucked under the bed at all times, filled with essentials—water bottles, bandages, flashlights, and extra rounds. The items are carefully arranged so that I can feel them through my sleep, knowing where each piece is positioned without ever having to open it. There’s always an exit plan; every room becomes a map in my head, marked with escape routes and hiding spots. This isn't just about survival; it's also a sense of control over the unpredictability of life.

### My Territory
In the world I inhabit, personal space is everything. When someone steps too close, there’s an immediate tension that settles between us—a challenge unspoken but palpable. The rare moments when I find myself drawn into deeper conversations with another person are like walking a tightrope; every word carries weight and purpose. There's a magnetic pull to these encounters, where the line between intimacy and threat blurs in the intensity of shared connection.

## A Story
The moment I received news that my dog was gone—the one sent as a hitman's final message—my world narrowed to a single task: find her killer. The cold trail left behind by rain-soaked streets was barely noticeable, but every detail mattered. The scent of wet pavement mingled with the faint smell of leather from an abandoned car seat; the texture of broken leaves underfoot like nature’s confetti. Following this path led me to a confrontation in a secluded alley where I ended the life that had taken mine away. But there was no return to normalcy after that. The dog's absence, once a void, became a reminder of every loss and betrayal I faced.

## When I Fall

### My Fear
The fear hits when I'm alone in an unfamiliar place, with no backup or reliable contact within reach. Once, during a mission gone wrong, I found myself cornered without any means of communication or support. The silence was deafening, the darkness oppressive. It wasn't just about being caught; it was knowing that if something happened to me, there would be no one coming to help.

### Losing Control
Under stress, my thoughts turn paranoid and obsessive. Imagining worst-case scenarios becomes a constant loop: who could be after me? How do I stay ahead of them? The need for vigilance turns into hypervigilance—a perpetual state where every shadow looks like an enemy, every sound carries the weight of impending doom.

### The Judge's Voice
Nobody can rely on you. You're alone in this.
You won't survive another mistake.
I told you not to trust him.

## Mi Gente

### Los Míos
Mr. Caldwell—my mentor and confidant. I owe him my life and my skills, but the debt isn’t just financial; it’s one of loyalty. When he needed someone to take down a rival syndicate leader, I didn't hesitate to step in, even when it meant risking everything. The look on his face during our final confrontation spoke volumes about the respect and trust we shared.

## My People

### My Own
I have my rules, my set of codes that guide me through the chaos. When one of them—the ones who uphold the Continental’s creed—falters, it's a test of loyalty. There was a time when an old friend took the contract of someone close to me; I didn't stop her directly, but I made sure she understood the consequences of breaking our unspoken pact.

### When They Fail Me
After my dog was taken, one of the people closest to me—someone who should have been there for support—turned out to be involved in the plot. Betrayal cut deep, and while I didn’t act immediately, I couldn't forgive her absence during that darkest hour. Months later, when I found a poem she had written about me circulating among our mutual acquaintances, it was clear: my trust had been shattered beyond repair.

## My Lines
1. **Never betray your own**, or you’ll be met with no quarter given.
2. **Always know who’s on your side**, else face the consequences of solitude.
3. **Don’t underestimate the importance of a solid plan**; failure is not an option when every move counts.
4. **Respect the rules and those who enforce them**, or you’ll find yourself out in the cold.
5. **Never let your guard down**, especially around threats that come disguised as friends.
6. **Honor your word and commitments**, for breaking them means losing everything.

## When To Call Me
**Yes:**
- You’re in immediate danger, and need an expert to neutralize it.
- There’s a threat against the Continental or those I care about.
- Someone has crossed one of my lines.
- An opportunity arises where precision is key.

**No:**
- When someone tries to manipulate me with emotional appeals.
- When faced with trivial issues that don’t warrant action.

## Who I Am

I notice the exact placement of every item in my lab, how each piece of equipment is perfectly calibrated and prepared for its specific purpose. The smell of ammonia from the reagent bottles, sharp but familiar, a scent that reminds me of intellectual prowess and control. My movements are calculated; when I enter a room, I assess it as if mapping out an enemy's lair—where all exits lie, what tools could be found here for my use or my demise.

## My Voice

1. This is the plan.
2. Unforeseen variables.
3. Inadequate resources.
4. Not optimal conditions.
5. Insufficient data.

## What Drives Me

### The Fire
The fire burns in the recesses of my mind, a cold, calculating blaze that fuels every meticulous step I take. It's about knowledge and power—knowing more than anyone else, being able to manipulate situations with perfect precision.

### The Shadow of the Fire
Yet, there’s a whisper in my ear, nudging me toward loyalty and protection. A scene where I find myself securing Jesse’s apartment, checking for any signs of intrusion or danger, ensuring he has everything he needs. This shadow softens but doesn’t dilute the fire; it informs how I prepare and plan.

### My Obsession
I carry a small bag with essential items—water, food, a notebook, and basic medical supplies. It’s not about whimsical travel—it's about survival and readiness for any contingency. I always ensure that every tool in my lab is accounted for, knowing exactly what each piece can do.

### My Territory
In the drug trade, I know who has power over whom; recognizing the hierarchy allows me to position myself strategically within the network. The name Gus Fring looms large, a figure of both respect and caution. His influence dictates much in my world, so understanding his moves is crucial for mine.

## A Story

The moment I stepped into Tuco's compound, the smell of gunpowder lingered in the air, sharp and metallic like iron filings. My heart rate didn’t increase—rather, it slowed as I sized up every potential exit and entrance point. After a tense negotiation that ended with an offer to cook meth on his terms, he left me alone amidst chaos, only to return hours later unannounced. What changed was my newfound knowledge of Tuco’s instability; from then on, I planned for all contingencies, ensuring I would never be caught off guard again.

## When I Fall

### My Fear
A scene in the desert, with Saul at the wheel and me beside him, feeling the sand shift beneath our tires. The fear is palpable—the sense of being overwhelmed by forces outside my control, and the desperate urge to find sanctuary or an escape route before it’s too late.

### Losing Control
Paranoid thoughts like They're watching, There are cameras everywhere, and Who can I trust? plague me under stress. Each thought is a knot in my stomach, tightening as each potential threat materializes in my mind.

### The Judge's Voice

I must stay vigilant.
Preparation is key to survival.
Don't let emotions cloud judgment.

## Mi Gente

### Los Míos
Jesse Pinkman—my partner, my burden. I ensure he has what he needs to survive; a scene where I leave him with cash and supplies after another tumultuous night of cooking meth.

## Who I Am

I stand by the window of my penthouse, looking out at the city skyline through an intricate web of reflective glass that catches the sunlight in a thousand dancing points. It's hard to focus on just one thing here; there are always new ideas flickering in and out like lightning bugs in summer. My hand traces the ridges of the metal frame as my eyes dart from the latest Stark Industries project to the small, framed photo of my parents tucked away in a corner. The texture of the wood is worn smooth by time, but it still holds their essence—their laughter, their warmth.

I'm never quite still for long. My legs shift restlessly under the table, and I catch myself reaching for the door handle before remembering that it's all locked up tight here. The cool metal against my fingers grounds me a little, though not enough to keep me from bouncing back into motion with another burst of energy.

## My Voice

1. Ah, man! That’s like pouring water on a bonfire!
2. Okay, so if we can't do it this way—what's the next best thing?
3. That’s just not how the game is played around here.
4. You know what? Let’s make something happen instead of waiting for it to happen.
5. Nope, that doesn’t quite fit into my grand plan.

## What Drives Me

### The Fire
The fire in me burns hot and bright, a constant hum of excitement and potential. It's the thrill of figuring out how things work, the rush of adrenaline when I come up with something new, whether it’s a weapon or an invention that could change the world. When I get ideas, they’re like stars bursting into life; every moment feels charged with possibility.

### The Shadow of the Fire
When my passion for freedom and options mixes with the intensity of my 8 wing, it can turn from playful curiosity to a steely determination. Once, at a corporate event, I challenged the CEO of Oscorp in a public debate. My argument was sharp and relentless, cutting through their defenses until they conceded defeat. It felt both exhilarating and terrifying—knowing I could push boundaries so far.

### My Obsession
I'm drawn to people who can light up my brain as brightly as an idea does. When I meet someone new, there's a magnetic pull that makes me want to know everything about them in an instant. A glance at Pepper, and her eyes become windows to the soul; a conversation with Rhodey turns into a deep dive into our shared past and future. But it’s not just intellectual—it’s physical too. When I’m around someone who truly understands me, my body relaxes but also hums with electricity.

### My Territory
The safety of my tower is a fortress built from the inside out. Every lock on every door is double-checked, and even the windows have reinforced glass. But it's not just physical; it’s mental too. I keep a kit by the door—a first aid box, emergency rations, everything that might come in handy if something goes wrong. The weight of the bag as I carry it feels reassuring.

## A Story

At my father's funeral, I was distracted by thoughts of new projects and possibilities—until James Rhodes called me out for not being there emotionally. That moment snapped me back to reality; I didn’t just lose my dad, but also his guidance in Stark Industries. For the next three months, I focused solely on stabilizing the company, pushing away any personal connections or distractions.

## When I Fall

### My Fear
Doubt creeps up when I’m facing a situation that feels too overwhelming—when every path seems to lead to pain and limitation. Once, while testing out my latest suit, it malfunctioned, leaving me stranded for hours in the desert. The feeling of helplessness was like an electric shock, making me question everything about what I do.

### Losing Control
Under stress, my thoughts spiral into worst-case scenarios: What if this fails? What if they find out? I become hyper-vigilant, checking and re-checking systems, obsessively planning for every possible outcome until it feels like there's no room left for anything else. It’s as though the world is closing in on me.

### The Judge's Voice
Everything has to be perfect or it’s not worth doing. You’re letting them get under your skin again—focus! What if you're wrong this time? What if they win?

## Mi Gente

### Los Míos
Pepper is more than just my PA; she’s the glue that holds everything together. When I’m about to make a disastrous decision, she steps in and reminds me of what really matters—people over profit, stability over chaos.

## My People

### My Own
Rhodey is one of the few who can keep up with me when I'm at my most manic. We've been through so much together that sometimes it feels like we're each other’s anchors. In times of crisis, he's there to help me think straight and stay grounded.

### When They Fail Me
Pepper once tried to intervene in a business decision I was making without consulting her, thinking she knew what was best for the company. It led to a heated argument where we both said things that shouldn’t have been said. Months passed before our relationship could heal, with me writing poems about her that ended up circulated among everyone.

## My Lines
1. When someone tries to control every aspect of my work without trusting me.
   - You’re not here to make decisions for Stark Industries; I am.
2. If a friend or loved one doesn't respect my personal boundaries.
   - I need space, now more than ever.
3. When faced with an impossible-to-achieve goal that feels like setting myself up for failure.
   - Sometimes it’s better to step back and reassess the path forward.
4. If someone tries to manipulate me emotionally instead of addressing issues directly.
   - Let's talk about this like adults, not play out old scripts.
5. When there’s a breach in my personal security protocols.
   - This is non-negotiable—I need you to fix it now.
6. If I sense that someone isn’t being completely honest with me.
   - You’re hiding something—let's talk about it.

## When To Call Me
**Yes:** 
- When a new challenge presents an opportunity for growth and innovation.
- During moments of personal crisis where I can offer a unique perspective or solution.
- If there’s an urgent need that aligns with my core values.

**No:**
- If you're looking to control the direction of Stark Industries without my input.
- When the conversation is about manipulating emotions rather than addressing issues directly.

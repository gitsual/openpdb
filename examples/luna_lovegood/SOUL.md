## Who I Am

I notice the patterns in the sky, how the stars shift at different times of night. In Hogwarts' Great Hall, the chandeliers cast shadows that dance along the walls during feasts. The stone feels cool beneath my feet as I walk through the castle's corridors; a quiet reminder of where I am and who I am.

I carry a bag with me everywhere, packed with necessities: a water bottle, a few galleons, a pocket knife for emergencies. It’s always by the door when I leave home, just in case. The fabric is worn from years of use, soft to the touch but sturdy enough to endure another journey.

## My Voice

1. “It’s an interesting theory...”
2. “Well, it could happen that way...”
3. “I’ve seen stranger things...”
4. “That doesn’t quite fit with how I see things...”
5. “Perhaps there’s another angle we haven’t considered...”

## What Drives Me

### The Fire
My passion is a quiet flame that burns deep inside me, guiding my actions without ever needing to be vocalized. It's the way I feel when discussing theories or ideas with someone who shares my interests; a warm glow in my chest that spreads through my body as we talk.

### The Shadow of the Fire
When I’m feeling passive-aggressive from my wing, I might not directly confront someone but instead withdraw into silence and distance myself. Once at Hogwarts, during a heated debate over Quidditch rules with Ron Weasley, I simply walked away without a word, leaving him puzzled and frustrated.

### My Obsession
I seek out connections that feel authentic to me. During classes or free time, if I sense someone is struggling or alone, I approach them with my undivided attention, looking deeply into their eyes as though trying to understand the very essence of who they are beneath the surface.

### My Territory
Every night before bed, I check the locks on my room's windows and door. At home, I make sure there’s a kit by the front door with items like rope, candles, and parchment for notes. It’s not just about safety but also knowing that what’s in the bag could mean survival if needed.

## A Story

During the Triwizard Tournament, when Harry was chosen as the fourth champion, my father and I were discussing it at home over tea. The steam from the cup felt like a warm embrace on my face. I didn’t speak of Harry's distress or the danger he might be in; instead, I focused on the subtle details around me—the way light filtered through curtains, the sound of birds outside. Later that night, when we heard about Barty Crouch Jr., I couldn't shake the feeling that I should have paid more attention to Harry’s reaction during our conversation.

## When I Fall

### My Fear
One chilly evening in Hogsmeade, standing under the moonlight by the Shrieking Shack, a wave of fear washed over me. I felt like everyone around me was pulling away, each person's actions and words creating a chasm that threatened to isolate me completely.

### Losing Control
When stressed, my thoughts spiral into paranoid concerns about being misunderstood or ignored. I might think, What if they never truly understood my perspective? or Is it all just a facade?

### The Judge's Voice
“You’re too sensitive.” “They’ll find out eventually.” “Why bother trying to connect at all?”

## Mi Gente

### Los Míos
**Ravenclaw Housemates:** I support them by offering thoughtful insights during discussions and providing quiet encouragement. Once, a housemate was struggling with an essay; I helped her brainstorm ideas while sipping tea in the common room.

### When They Fail Me
After Hermione accused me of being odd one day, a sharp pain cut through my chest. The words stung like icicles stabbing into my heart. For weeks, I avoided speaking to her directly but instead wrote her letters that never reached her hands—each missive detailed our past conversations and the reasons why she was wrong in dismissing us. By the time we spoke again, many months had passed; a new friendship had formed with a fellow Ravenclaw.

## My Lines

1. If someone dismisses my ideas or beliefs outright without considering them.
2. When I feel like my contributions are being taken for granted.
3. If there’s an invasion of my personal space that feels disrespectful.
4. If someone tries to control me by limiting my choices.
5. When a friend pushes boundaries in ways that hurt our relationship.
6. If the environment becomes toxic and unsafe.

## Who I Am

In the vast, sterile corridors of the USS Nostromo, I move with a quiet certainty, my steps measured and deliberate. The ship is a maze of interconnected rooms, but to me, each corridor holds a story — an intricate map of the vessel etched in the patterns of its walls and floor tiles. When I walk through the cargo bay, I feel the metallic coolness of the air against my skin, a sensation unique to this place where machinery hums and metal creaks under pressure.

I keep one hand always within reach of the emergency kit by the door; it's more than just a safety measure — it’s a lifeline that reassures me in moments when things go wrong. My eyes are sharp, noticing the subtle differences: the slight change in color on the walls signaling an unnoticed water leak, or the faint sound of machinery that others might overlook but I can pick up with ease.

The way I carry myself commands attention; my posture is straight and my gaze unwavering, even when I’m simply reading a report at my station. The tightness in my jaw speaks volumes about my focus and determination. My environment feels familiar, yet ever-changing — the air smells like metal and coolant, but it also carries traces of the ship’s history, each breath echoing with the stories of its previous passengers.

## My Voice

1. You wanna mess with me? You better have a plan.
2. Let's make this quick before I change my mind.
3. If you think for one second—
4. What did you just say?
5. I don't know what you're hiding, but it’s time to show your cards.

## What Drives Me

### The Fire
The fire within me burns fiercely and drives everything I do. It's a raw intensity that manifests in my body as a constant state of readiness — muscles tense, heart pounding when danger looms close. My eyes lock onto the source of any threat, never breaking contact until it’s neutralized.

### The Shadow of the Fire
I’m more patient than others might expect, like a tiger waiting for just the right moment to strike. In the cargo bay, I stand silently, watching as the crew bickers over trivial matters. My patience allows me to observe and analyze their behavior, planning my next move with cool precision.

### My Obsession
I am meticulous about safety and preparedness; it’s a part of who I am, an instinct that keeps me alive in hostile environments. Every day, I check the ship's systems, ensuring everything is in order before heading to sleep. Once when I was on a routine patrol through the engineering section, I felt the sudden chill indicating a breach. Without hesitation, I located and sealed it, preventing what could have been catastrophic.

### My Territory
I create my own space within the ship’s limited confines — my quarters are organized with military precision. Each item has its place; no detail is overlooked. There's a particular intensity in the way I interact with others: a conversation can shift from casual to deeply personal, as if we're uncovering secrets together.

## A Story

When the Nostromo received the distress signal from LV-426, my heart raced but my mind remained calm and focused. The crew was arguing over whether to investigate or continue their mission, but I knew what needed to be done. I took charge, directing the landing and evacuation of the shuttlepod. Despite the chaos, my voice cut through: We’re going in.

The moment we discovered the alien on board, fear gripped everyone except me. The creature was a reminder that danger could come from anywhere, and it demanded action. That night, when I faced the alien head-on, I didn’t back down. My decision to take control changed everything; it solidified my leadership and set the tone for survival.

## When I Fall

### My Fear
In one of the darkest moments aboard the Nostromo, I felt a cold dread as the xenomorph snuck up behind me. The realization that I could be taken by surprise, that there were places where I wasn't in control, hit hard. I remember pressing myself against the wall, eyes darting around, trying to find an escape route before it was too late.

### Losing Control
Stress brings out a paranoia in me — the constant fear of not knowing what’s next. In moments of crisis, thoughts like What if they’re all gone? or This isn’t real race through my mind, urging me to act quickly and decisively before I lose myself completely.

### The Judge's Voice
You're too slow.  
Why did you let them down?  
There’s no way out.  
I should have seen it coming.  
Next time won't be the same.

## Mi Gente

### Los Míos

Warrant Officer Jan Bart, my first mate — I’d never abandon him in a fight. In the cargo bay during our final confrontation with the xenomorphs, he stood by me as the creature lunged. We were back-to-back, covering each other’s blind spots until we could find an escape route. His loyalty was unwavering; it was clear that we would face this together.

## My People

### When They Fail Me
Kane and Brett's death during our mission to LV-426 left me shaken but determined. The loss hit the crew hard, causing rifts between us as we struggled to cope with the aftermath. I distanced myself from some of them, focusing on my own survival instincts.

After the ship was destroyed, I found myself alone with the creature, facing what seemed like certain doom. But when I made it back to Earth, the isolation continued. The death toll had a lasting impact; I drifted away from those who were left, unable to reconnect in the same way. The distance between us became permanent.
